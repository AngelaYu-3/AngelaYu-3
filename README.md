## Hi, I'm Angela! 👩🏻‍💻

I am an undergraduate President's Scholar pursuing a Computer Engineering BS at the University of Maryland, College Park. 

I am interested in applications & optimizations of machine learning, intersections of hardware & software (computer architecture, operating systems etc), and intersections of technology & law especially in regards to AI regulation.

Please check out the pinned repositories below to view some of my latest projects! 

If any of the above points pique your interest, reach out at yuangela12@gmail.com

Thanks for stopping by :)
