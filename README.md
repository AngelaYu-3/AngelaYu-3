## Hi, I'm Angela! 👩🏻‍💻

I am a President's Scholar at the University of Maryland, College Park pursuing an undergraduate Computer Engineering Major with a Science, Technology, Ethics, and Policy Minor. 

I am interested in applications of machine learning, integration of hardware and software (computer architecture, operating systems etc), and intersectional areas of technology and policy especially in regards to AI regulation.

Please check out the pinned repositories below to view some of my latest projects! 

If any of the above points pique your interest, reach out at yuangela12@gmail.com

Thanks for stopping by :)
